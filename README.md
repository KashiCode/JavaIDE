# JavaIDE

# üîç Introduction
JavaIDE is a Discord bot developed using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). Serving as a proof of concept, this application redefines the boundaries of Discord bot functionalities by allowing users to execute Java files directly within Discord.

# üåê Features

### Core Feature
- **Java File Execution:** Simply upload a `.java` file to discord, and our bot will allow you to interact with it and view the final output.

  

### Current Features
- **OpenAI Support:** Descriptive debugging and code explanation using OpenAI.
- **Multiple Function Execution:** Execute code with various functions and different code lengths.
- **User Input Support:** Accepts simple user inputs into the system.
- **Diverse Input Data Types:** Including boolean, strings, and more.
- **Data Structures:** Supports arrays, abstract data types (ADT), and records.
- **Import Statements:** Compatibility with most import statements.
- **General Features:** Includes basic tutorials on installing Java and using the application.

### Upcoming Features
- **Language Expansion:** Integration and support for Python and other programming languages.
- **Graphical Interface Support:** Enabling the bot to work with GUIs.
- **External Dependencies:** Expanding the scope to include more external dependencies.
- **IDE integration:** Enabling users to edit `.java` files within discord and delete or write code.
- **Sandboxing and security** Expanding on the security features to include a sandbox environment and additional precautions.

Note: There are some restrictions with JavaIDE Bot due to Discord's limitations. For instance, it doesn't support:
- Files that need an input or output over 2000 characters.
- Multiple dependencies that aren't part of the JDK.
- Code that uses a GUI.

We encourage suggestions for improvements and new features!
